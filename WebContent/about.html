			<h1>An unchanging world</h1>

			<p>There are times when we notice small things which we can fix by ourselves, 
			but we leave it to others to do the job. Unattended, the problem which was small yesterday 
			becomes a huge nuisance today. Litter in the streets, clogged drainways, there are so many 
			things we can fix ourselves, but we choose otherwise, only to complaint about it later.</p>

	 		<h1>Hoping for a change</h1>

	 		<p>Niryamana intends to be the platform where people can come together to find ways to solve 
	 		these everyday problems. And the best part, they do so voluntarily, without expecting anything 
	 		in return. Okay, maybe a little thank you won't hurt anyone, but other than that, there's no 
	 		payment involved for the volunteers.</p>
 		</div>

 		<div class="box1">
	 		<h1>Our sole motivation</h1>

	 		<p>We realize that it's an ambitious project, and the world we usually portray is not a 
	 		place where such an idea can flourish. However, we believe in one of the core traits of 
	 		human beings; humanity. It's something we all have, and we are counting on it to bring about 
	 		small changes in the world we live in. 

			The possibilities are endless; it's up to you to see where we go from here.

			Welcome to Niryamana. We hope you find what you were looking for.</p>

			<h1>How did this even began?</h1>

			<p>There's a joke in Sicily, that the world is too cruel for a child to have just a single 
			father. Niryamana is the child of five fathers, and each of us contribute to the seriousness 
			of the joke.

			Niryamana started as an idea of a teenager, still green in the ways of the world. Soon though, 
			it took ahold of four college students, who were looking for an idea for their college project. 
			This unlikely collaboration ended up creating a web portal, with a singular aim to help. Even 
			the name, Niryamana, comes from Sanskrit, and means assistance.</p>
